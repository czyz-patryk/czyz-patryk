Hello,

I'm Patryk Czyż from Poland.
I have a bachelor's degree of Mathematics.

I started learning programming in April 2022. My first choice was Python, then I tried some JavaScript and after that I have learned basics of Java. 
If I had to chose my favourite, I would choose Python.

In the nearest future I'm going to learn something about Data Science, because data, tables and number are awesome.

I don't have any experience but I'm looking for my first job in IT.

My email: patrykczyz2@gmail.com
